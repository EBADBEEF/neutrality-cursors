This is the source to generate an XCursor mouse cursors theme.

The cursors have a size of 24 pixels only (slightly larger with shadows). Not
for high dpi (HiDPI).

It is based off of existing cursor themes but with some changes. All CSS
cursors and Freedesktop.org cursors are specified now. A few stylistic changes
were made as well.
